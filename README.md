This is a tentative repo for the CSULB Friend Finder app. All high-level communication (not contained in a specific code file or a Wiki page) should go here. - Tan

So far looks like we’re leaning towards a “friend finder” app that will update in regular intervals to locate your friends and implement a pathfinding system to quickly meet up with them.

in terms of features
-GPS tracking (phone services)
-Pathfinding (can connect using google maps)
	-Add in shuttle information

Extra features
-Add to a class schedule program so you can know when people get out
-Meet up points?
- Kane

September 2, 2014 - Armondo, David, Gustavo, Nick, Tan present.
- We decided to build the Friend Finder, and made this repo (which includes a page for Mr. Boctor and a wiki for, as of now, editing the proposal that will be due next Thursday 9/11. We decided on developing it for iOS 7.1, and testing it on our iPhones.
- Even though we will all be programming, we also have high-level project roles:
- 	Armondo: Feature and Concept Visionary. He came up with the initial set of features, and will continue to adapt the features as we develop.
- 	David and Nick: User Experience Designers. After Armondo defines the features, David and Nick draw the graphical user interface for those features. Indeed, they control the app's look from start to finish.
- 	Gustavo: Scrum Project Owner. As Armondo, David, and Nick design the app, Gustavo guides them with comments and makes decisions in case of deadlock. At the end of each sprint's design process, he is the final person to approve or disapprove of them.
-	Kane: Chief Software Architect. All of us have little to no iOS development experience. Whether Kane does or not, he will have the final authority on software architecture and programming convention: the classes, the objects, the functions, the data flows, etc.
-	Tan: Scrum master. Tan will set goals for Scrum sprints and coordinate timely delivery of promised features for each sprint.
